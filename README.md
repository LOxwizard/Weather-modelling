This Repo consistes of the weather modelling codes with respective to Waterfall_model , Iterative_model , Agile_model.

1. Waterfall_model:
     consists of 3 parts where it is calculated using:
                                         1. Hard-coded values
                                         2. Keyboard Input
                                         3. File input
2. Iterative model:
    consists of a code which plots the matplot values incrementing the values of a to see the change in the weather pattern.


3. Agile model:
     consists of a code which plots the weather conditions in matplot from the data with small increments
